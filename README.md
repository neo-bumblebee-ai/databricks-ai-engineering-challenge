# Databricks AI Engineering Challenge

This repository tracks my work for the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge organized by Codebasics and Indian Data Club.

The goal is simple: ship daily work with clean structure, repeatable notebooks, and clear engineering decisions.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` Exported Databricks notebooks (source)
- `docs/` Architecture notes, data model, and key decisions
- `screenshots/` Execution proof used for daily updates
- `exports/` Optional HTML exports

## Progress Log
- Day 0: Environment setup and dataset onboarding
- Day 1: Platform basics and first PySpark workflow
